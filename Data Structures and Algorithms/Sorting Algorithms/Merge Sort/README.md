# Merge Sort

An efficient sorting algorithm that uses divide and conquer. It recursively divides the array into halves, sorts the halves and merges them.


### Time Complexity

Best Case: Ω(n log(n))

Average Case: θ(n log(n))

Worst Case: O(n log(n))

where n represents the size of the array.


### Space Complexity

Worst Case: O(n)

where n represents the size of the array.


### Input Format

The first line contains an integer `n`, the size of array.

The next line contains `n` space-separated integers `arr[i]` where 0 ≤ `i` < `n`.


### Output Format

The array `arr` in sorted order.


### Sample Input

```
5
5 3 1 2 4
```
