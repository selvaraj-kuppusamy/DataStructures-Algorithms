# Selection Sort

A sorting algorithm that repeatedly finds the minimum element from the unsorted sublist and appends it to the end of the sorted sublist.

### Time Complexity

Best Case:Ω(n²)

Average Case:θ(n²)

Worst Case:O(n²)

When n represents the size of the array

### Space Complexity

Worst Case:O(1)

### Input Format

The first line contains an integer `n`, the size of array.

The next line contains `n` space-separated integers `arr[i]` where 0 ≤ `i` < `n`.


### Output Format

The array `arr` in sorted order.


### Sample Input

```
5
5 3 1 2 4
```


### Sample Output

```
1 2 3 4 5
```
