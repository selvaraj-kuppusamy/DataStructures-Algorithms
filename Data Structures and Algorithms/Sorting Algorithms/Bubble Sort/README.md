# Bubble Sort`

A sorting algorithm that repeatedly compares adjacent pairs and swaps them if they are in the wrong order. It is named for the way smaller or larger elements _bubble_ to the top.


### Time Complexity

Best Case: Ω(n)

Average Case: θ(n²)

Worst Case: O(n²)

where n represents the size of the array.


### Space Complexity

Worst Case: O(1)

### Input Format

The first line contains an integer `n`, the size of array.

The next line contains `n` space-separated integers `arr[i]` where 0 ≤ `i` < `n`.


### Output Format

The array `arr` in sorted order.


### Sample Input

```
5
5 3 1 2 4
```


### Sample Output

```
1 2 3 4 5
```
